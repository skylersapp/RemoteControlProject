#### Overview
We are going to simulate a remote control. It will have buttons "0" to "9", "ON", and "OFF". In order to operate the remote control, the user must first turn it on. Nothing else will be allowed to be "pressed". Once it is turned on, the user can enter a number from 0 through 9, simulating button presses and sounds, or turn the remote control back off. Turning it off is the only way to close the program. 

#### Concepts
* **Java programming language**

	* while; do - while loops
	* multiple method calls
	* switches (with fall-through)
	* importing resources (scanner)
	* auto case-conversion
	

* **ascii images**

	* using multiple print lines with characters to create the appearance of on-screen images. 
	
* **Markdown language (for README file)**

	* image insertion
	* header creation
	* emboldening
	* list creation
	
	
#### Technologies Used
* **Java programming language**

	* see "Concepts" above
	
* **Eclipse IDE**

	* project and class creation
	* use of console 
	
* **git/github**
	
	* repository creation
	* git staging  and committing
	* git pushes using terminal

* **Apple MacBook Pro**

	* keyboard shortcuts
	* multi-tasking for a more efficient coding environment
				
* **Terminal** 

	* operating at the command line for tasks such as file creation/manipulation and git communicaiton

#### Lessons Learned

Coming from a background of literally zero coding experience, this project was both edifying and enjoyable. The most surprising thing for me, was seeing how, between eight of us, there were eight nearly completely different ways of completing this project. I, for instance, used no integer variables or "if" statements. I also used fall-through coding in my switch body, while others did not. The biggest lesson learned here for me was that there doesn't seem to be one single "right answer", which really highlighted the need for industry conventions and best practices. It really reinforced for me the need to make sure I'm not coding in unique or "out-of-the-box" ways in order to make sure my code is readable by others; ctrl-shift-f has become my best friend in making sure everything looks good and clean. I also now recognize the need for committing often. 

I am very excited for the remaining 15 weeks of this program, including the challenge that comes with it.
